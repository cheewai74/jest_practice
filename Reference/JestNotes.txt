Tests typically contain these general components:
1. a describe function is invoked which accepts two arguments:
2. a string (a description that will appear in the terminal when tests are run, which “describes” the test block)
3. a callback function which will contain the individual tests..
4. One (or more) test function which accepts two arguments:
5. a string describing the action of the specific test,
6. a callback function containing an expect function and a matcher function.
7. The expect function accepts the function invocation being tested, and is chained to the matcher which describes the expected results.

The Jest framework has a number of defined matchers, such as:
1. toBeNull matches only null
2. toBeUndefined matches only undefined
3. toBeDefined is the opposite of toBeUndefined
4. toBeTruthy matches anything that an if statement treats as true
5. toBeFalsy matches anything that an if statement treats as false
6. toBeGreaterThan or toBeLessThan for number value comparisons
7. toMatch accepts a Regex pattern to match a string output
8. toContain can be used to see if a value is contained in an Array
